## TODO
- [ ] Create a testing repo to include the common testing utilities
- [ ] Finally remembered SecurityRule.isAuthenticated. Can remove the "approved user" role
- [ ] Revisit HATEOAS implementation. This doesn't seem like the way it's intended to be used but I can't find any examples or documentation on how to use it.
